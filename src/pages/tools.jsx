          <ToolsSection title="Workstation">
            <Tool title="13” MacBook Pro, Intel i7, 16GB RAM (2013)">
              I have had this laptop for 10 years and it works great. The truth
              is, no one needs a fancy computer for web dev.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Apple Pro Display XDR (Standard Glass)">
              The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and
              bigger than 27”. When you’re working at planetary scale, every
              pixel you can get counts.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard">
              A decent keyboard with a split left and right design. I find that
              split keyboards greatly reduce the amount of hand and wrist pain.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Apple Magic Trackpad">
              Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with
              special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special
              powers.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Herman Miller Aeron Chair">
              If I’m going to slouch in the worst ergonomic position imaginable
              all day, I might as well do it in an expensive chair.
            </Tool>
          </ToolsSection>
          <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
            <Tool title="Visual Studio Code">
              Pretty much the industry standard IDE. I find the Stripe and
              Docker extensions to be particularly useful.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="iTerm2">
              I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that
              aren’t just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="TablePlus">
              Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
              building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
              over the years.
            </Tool>
          </ToolsSection>
          <ToolsSection title="Design">
            <Tool title="Figma">
              We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become
              our virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have
              expected the collaboration features to be the real hook.
            </Tool>
          </ToolsSection>
          <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
            <Tool title="Alfred">
              It’s not the newest kid on the block but it’s still the fastest.
              The Sublime Text of the application launcher world.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Reflect">
              Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
              organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
              Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
              discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
              daily note.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="SavvyCal">
              Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar
              and making sure I still have lots of time for deep work during the
              week.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Focus">
              Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just
              do the work and get some momentum going.
            </Tool>
